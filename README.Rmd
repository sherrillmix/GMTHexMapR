#  Make pretty hex maps out of position data using Generic Mapping Tools

## Introduction

Hexplots can be a handy way to look at the spatial distribution of a lot of data all at once. Here's a bunch of R code that reads in data from the Douglas filter (or skip the reading in and just use anything else that has a lat, lon, animal ID and date) and makes pretty maps of hexes out of it using Generic Mapping Tools (GMT). There's just two main functions to get you started making your own maps. 

This is some old code that I am cleaning up so use at your own risk.
